# JavaScript API

The script triggers itself on load, on DOM ready, when the browser window resizes and if new elements are added to the DOM. If you want to trigger it manually you can call `reprocess` (step 1), `reparse` (step 2) or `reevaluate` (step 3) on the `window.cqApi` object. Most of the time `reevaluate` should do the job if you didn’t add, remove or change stylesheets. E.g.

```js
document.querySelector('.element').addEventListener('click', function() {
	// Do something that changes the size of container elements
	// ...
	window.cqApi.reevaluate(false, function() {
		// Do something after all elements were updated
	});
});
```

If you installed the prolyfill as a normal script the API is available at `window.cqApi`. If you’re using a module loader the API gets returned from the module function.

## `reprocess(fn callback)`

Reprocess all stylesheets on the page. Call this method if you added a stylesheet via JavaScript. The `callback` gets called after all stylesheets are processed, parsed and evaluated.

## `reparse(fn callback)`

Reparse all stylesheets on the page and look for new container queries. Call this method if you added a stylesheet via JavaScript which doesn’t contain a container query. The `callback` gets called after all stylesheets are parsed and evaluated.

## `reevaluate(bool clearCache, fn callback, array contexts)`

Reevaluate all container queries. Call this method if you added new elements or changed styles that affect a container query. The boolean parameter `clearCache` specifies if the container cache should be cleared before the evaluation. The `callback` gets called after all container queries are evaluated. You can optionally pass an array of DOM elements as `contexts` if you only want to reevaluate some parts of the page.
